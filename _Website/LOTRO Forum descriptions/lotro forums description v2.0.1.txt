I just released the initial public version (v2.0.1) of Festival Buddy II, based on Galuhad's Festival Buddy, at [URL='https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1218-FestivalBuddyII.html']lotrointerface.com[/URL]. This plugin is designed to help you with festivities through-out Middle-earth.

There have been numerous festival changes since Festival Buddy's last update in 2014, and the number of changes I've been making mean releasing them as a patch no longer makes sense.

Festival Buddy II currently supports:
[LIST]
[*]Spring (March)
[*]Anniversary (April/May)
[*]Midsummer (June)
[*]Summer / Farmers Faire (August/September)
[*]Harvestmath (October)
[*]Yule (December)
[*]Hobnanigans (Various)
[/LIST]

The Hedge Maze during the Spring Festival can be difficulty to navigate. Festival Buddy II includes an in-game map that highlights the objectives of the various maze quests and responds to the /loc command to show you where you are.

Midsummer is a complicated festival. Festival Buddy II includes a Quick Guide you can use to help complete the interwoven quests of Minas Tirith.

Please let me know if you spot any errors, or if you have any requests.
