Festival Buddy II is a simple tool to help you keep track of the festivities through-out Middle-earth. It is an updated version of the original [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info767-FestivalBuddy.html]Festival Buddy, by Galuhad[/url].

It will display the number of tokens in your wallet, when some effects have expired (e.g. the treasure chests in the Haunted Barrow), and a simple quest guide for those quests that are easily forgotten. There's also a dance instructor to help you with the dance quests, and a barter list showing the cost of all the items at the festival so you can refer to it on the go.

Midsummer is a complicated festival. It now has an integrated Quick Guide (based on [url=https://lifebeyondtheshire.com/lotro-midsummer-festival-quick-guide/]LilRedHead's Quick Guide[/url]) you can use to keep track of all the interwoven quests of Minas Tirith. You can see a full walkthrough of the Minas Tirith Midsummer quests [url=https://youtu.be/FNFE1VSqW5g]here[/url].

Festival Buddy II is available at present in English and partially in French and German.

This plugin adds the following commands when loaded:
/festival - Shows/hides the main window.

Current festivals supported: Spring, Anniversary, Midsummer, Summer / Farmers Faire, Harvestmath, Yule, Hobnanigans.

Please let me know if you spot any errors, or if you have any requests.

[list]
[*] If a midsummer quick guide objective both ends a quest and tries to specify the next quest to be loaded into the main UI, the quest does not load into the main UI.
[*] Hobnanigans is missing French and German strings, so automatic scoreboard doesn't work yet.
